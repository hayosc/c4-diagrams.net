# EasyC4 in Bundeslayout for diagrams.net

This is an adaptation of the original EasyC4 library in the colours of Bundesregierung CI as documented at https://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/sg-de/basiselemente/farben.

Check out the original library at https://github.com/maciek365/c4-diagrams.net.

All copyright is either on Maciek Sliwinski as the original author of the library or the German government (Bundesregierung) for the colour scheme. No rights are claimed by me (Hayo).

In the following you find mostly the original text of the EasyC4 library, where the images are replaced.

Please also check the **newest version** of Maciek's plugin available at https://github.com/hycomsa/hycom-c4

The new version contains slightly smaller, more compact elements - seems to be more readable. You also find there additional types of containers - web browser and mobile application. Maybe new version will be more suitable for you.

The **EasyC4** library is for quick and convenient visualising software architecture using the **C4 model** approach. The library contains a set of aesthetic **C4 notation** elements and lets you create C4 diagrams in the *diagrams.net* / *draw.io* application.

The **EasyC4** provides the following easy to use elements:
- Person (internal and external)
- Software system (internal and external)
- Container (generic, data, microservice and message bus)
- Component
- Relationship (with description and technology, with description only and plain)
- Scope boundary (software system and container)
- Diagram title (for system context, containers and components diagrams)
- Legend
